  ### Description
  This project enables the user to write a quality README file directly in the command line interface. By simply following the prompts and answering a series of questions about their project, the user will return a readme.md file fully formatted in Markdown, including Table of Contents, section headers, link to GitHub account, email address, license of their choosing, and license badge.
  
  ### Installation
  As this is a CLI-based program, you must fork the program from my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Jacquie24/readme-generator) and run it in the terminal locally.
  
  ### Usage
  The README Generator is available for anyone who wants to create a quality readme file with very little effort.
  
  ### Contributing
  If you'd like to contribute -- ideas for new headings, additional licenses, etc. -- please add your comments below, and I may include them in future updates.
